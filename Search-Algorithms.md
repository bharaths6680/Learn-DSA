**Learn Search Algorithms in JS**

1. Depth first search (DFS)
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Summary**
1. Both BFS and DFS  have a time complexity of O(v+E), where V is the no of vertices and E is the no of edges
2. Each Vertex and edge is explored at most once.
3. DFS has a space complexity of O(V) due to the recursuion stack
4. BFS has a space complexity of O(V) due to the queue stack
