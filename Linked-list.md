### Definition of Array and Linked List:

1. **Array**:
   An **array** is a data structure that stores a collection of elements (values or variables) in **contiguous memory locations**. All the elements in an array are of the same data type, and they are accessed using an index. 

   - **Key characteristics:**
     - **Fixed size**: Once an array is created, its size is fixed.
     - **Random access**: You can access any element directly using its index in constant time, i.e., O(1).
     - **Efficient for reading**: Accessing or reading elements is fast.
     - **Insertion and deletion**: Inserting or removing elements can be slow because it may require shifting elements.

   **Example**:  
   ```python
   arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]  # Array of 4 elements
   print(arr[2])  # Accessing element at index 2 -> Outputs: 30
   ```

2. **Linked List**:
   A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains two parts: 
   - **Data**: The actual data.
   - **Pointer (or link)**: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
   
   **The nodes are not stored in contiguous memory locations**;
   instead, each node points to the next node, forming a chain-like structure. T
   here are several types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

   - **Key characteristics:**
     - **Dynamic size**: The size of a linked list can grow or shrink dynamically.
     - **Sequential access**: To access a specific element, you must start from the first node and follow the links.
     - **Efficient for insertions/deletions**: Inserting or deleting elements (especially in the middle) is efficient because you only update the pointers.

### Summary:
- **Array**: Fixed size, fast access (O(1)), but slow insertions/deletions.
- **Linked List**: Flexible size, slow access (O(n)), but fast insertions/deletions.
