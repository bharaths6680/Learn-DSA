**What is Algorithms?**

*Algorithms are step-by-step instructions or procedures that solve a specific problem or perform a specific task.*

**In Computer Sceience** algorithms are fundamental to solving problems efficiently and effectively. They are designed to take inputs, process them using a series of logical steps, and produce desired outputs

//There are various types of algorithms, such as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and many more. Each algorithm is designed to solve a specific type of problem or perform a specific task
