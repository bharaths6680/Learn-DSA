### Additional Notes for Experienced Developers
For an experienced full-stack frontend developer:
- **Complexity**: Interviewers will focus on algorithmic efficiency and time/space complexity analysis.
- **System Design**: Be prepared for **system design questions**, which might involve designing scalable and efficient front-end architectures, caching strategies, load balancing, etc.
- **Frontend Optimization**: Knowledge of front-end performance optimization techniques, such as tree shaking, lazy loading, code splitting, etc., could also be tested.

To prepare well, focus not only on coding but also on explaining your thought process clearly, optimizing the solutions, and discussing trade-offs between time and space complexities.
